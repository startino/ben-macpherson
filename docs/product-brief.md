After signing the NDA, sending these assets will allow us to work much closer by understanding the process on a much deeper level:

- Example surveys
- Full list of platforms necessary to integrate
- Access to LookerStudio examples
- Case-studies
- Internal SOPs

## **Core Value Proposition**

A first-party persona intelligence + creative system for DTC brands. It ingests data and survey responses, identifies the highest-value customer personas, tracks acquisition mix in real time, and generates persona-specific creative and messaging to shift spend toward profitable customers. Less time in spreadsheets and reports, more profit from the right buyers.

## **Primary Job to Be Done**

Help (luxury) DTC brands consistently acquire more high-value customers (and stop paying for low-value ones) by making their creative, targeting, and budget allocation persona-smart.

## **Key User Persona Details**

- **Profile:** Head of Growth / Performance Lead / Founder at a DTC brand (~$5M–$50M GMV)
- **Pain Points:**
    - Manual, laggy reporting to understand “who” is actually profitable
    - Creative and targeting aimed at “everyone,” wasting media on low-value cohorts
    - Fragmented tools; no single source of truth for persona mix and profit impact
- **Buying Triggers:** CAC rising, LTV stagnating, platform automation commoditizing media buying, board pressure for profit not just revenue.
- **Objections:** “We already do cohorts in GA/Shopify,” “Surveys are slow/low-response,” “AI creative won’t match brand voice.”
- **Success Metric For User:** [Ben: pick ONE North Star—e.g., “Increase share of high-value persona orders from X% → Y% within 90 days,” or “Cut CAC payback for top persona to ≤ Z days,” or “+20% incremental contribution margin in 90 days.”]

We will also keep an eye on agencies managing brands from (1) and we white-label the software to them.

## **MVP Success Criteria (KPIs)**

- **10 Evangelists:** 10 brands who love it and actively recommend it because they saw **results**.
- **User-side North Star:** [Ben to confirm chosen metric above.]
- **Agency-side North Star (ops):** ≥ [Ben: how many hours are currently spent (roughly) on this task (will be exact after ValueTracker)] hours saved
- **Time to First Insight:** First persona map with creative briefs in ≤ [Ben: what’s the current timeline to deliver the reports?] days.
- **Time to First Lift:** Detectable improvement toward the North Star in ≤ [Ben: average time to see ROI] days.

## **How It Works**

📡

The MVP’s scope will be discussed and finalized in a call.

</aside>

1. **Inputs (connect & configure)**
    - Connect Shopify, GA4, Meta, Google Ads, Klaviyo, etc.
    - Launch survey (brand ESP or hosted link) to recent buyers; capture psychographics, affinities, and product intents.
2. **Persona Intelligence**
    - Cluster customers by value (RFM/LTV/profit) + survey signals to form actionable personas.
    - Map acquisition sources, first-product affinities, and predicted payback per persona.
    - Set a recommended **target mix** (shift spend toward high-value personas).
3. **Creative & Strategy Layer**
    - Generate persona-specific creative briefs: angles, hooks, product pairings, email flows, landing page cues, influencer archetypes.
    - Produce draft ad/email copy and image prompts matched to each persona.
    - Recommend budget reallocation and testing plan (what to scale, what to cut).
4. **Outputs / Deliverables**
    - **Real-time dashboard:** persona share over time, profitability bridge, drift vs target mix, CAC payback by persona.
    - **Creative pack:** briefs + drafts ready for brand review and execution.
    - **Exports:** CSVs of persona labels, recommended segments, and creative artifacts.
5. **Ops & Automation (Agency)**
    - Use **ValueTracker** to baseline current manual hours for persona/reporting/creative prep, then quantify hours saved post-MVP.

## **Competitors & Alternatives**

### Decile

- Third-party + first-party data customer analytics.
- **Why we win:** tighter persona-level creative generation, real-time persona mix tracking tied to profit, and a clearer execution bridge (briefs → drafts).

### DIY (GA/Shopify + Surveys + Sheets/Looker)

- Teams stitch tools together manually.
- **Why we win:** speed to insight, hours saved, consistent creative system, drift alerts, and a proven strategy for budget allocation, creatives, etc.

### In-house BI / Agencies’ internal dashboards

- Custom, expensive, slow to evolve.
- **Why we win:** productized best practices from 500+ years of combined experience from D.LUX team, faster iteration, lower total cost of ownership.

## **Goals & Vision**

**Short-term (MVP, 60–90 days)**

- **SaaS Side:** Hit **10 Evangelists** (Evangelists are users that love the product so much that they share it **because** they’ve achieved **results**)
- **Agency Side:** Demonstrate ≥ [Ben: target] hours saved per client/month.

**Long-term (Product Studio)**

- Suite with add-on modules
- Commercial target: **$50k+ MRR** across product(s); position for strategic exit or as the backbone of an AI-first agency.
