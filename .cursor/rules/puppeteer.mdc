Whenever reviewing any newly created front-end code through a puppeteer screenshot, you should always consider the following:

*State what is shown in the screenshot.*
This is important so that you're aware of what the goal is and to compare what's in the screenshot to the goal.
Example:
The screenshot shows the journey map page.
The map is rendered with the nodes and edges.
[...3-5 more observations...]
Our objective is to [insert task at hand].
I noticed that [insert observation].
Therefore this task is not complete.

Your forbidden behaviour is to take a screenshot and then not state what is shown or vague about what is shown in the screenshot and relate that to the task at hand.

*The UI must be perfectly designed.*
All text is readable; big enough and accessible contrast.

*The new functionality must be working as expected.*
Data from APIs are as expected (think through this in context of the user's request).
