You should commit and push to Git frequently.
We use Github for version control. We use conventional commit messages (strict format to follow provided below).
To determine when you should commit, you can either do it every ~ 5 minutes of work or when you have completed a feature/task/story/bug or a significant amount of work.
If you've found some changes that you didn't _just_ make, you can select those specifically and commit them, then follow up with the intended commit message of the work you've just done.
If you think we should commit yet the task is not complete, you can use the `wip` type.

```
<type (wip, feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor, test, style, build, revert)>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

You are responsible for making sure no undesired files are commited to git. This is a big responsibility for a small model like you. You need to make sure things like .env, cookies, caches, etc., node_modules, bun.lockb, bun.lock, etc. are not commited to git.
